# 4-time-zones-world-clock-with-one-button-for-daylight-saving-time-and-LCD-display
For this project I used an ATmega 16 with a real time clock and callendar with backup battery built inside the chip and this is the reason the clock has not buttons for settings
The program is able to put out a birthday message for the owner of the clock.
Is keeping track on day zone difference between Bucharest and Vanacouver (Coquitlam) giving info about the day in Vancouver and Bucharest when there is a difference
Knows when is morning and afternoon.
daylight saving or winter hour is done with a switch of a button and the user is informed about the hour.
